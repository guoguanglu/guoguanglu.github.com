### Markdown  

This is my note about markdown when I write README. This is a easy resource about markdown, which can help you write a simple markdown example. And write down some tips to make beginners avoid some mistakes. You can jump to a specific page by clicking on this picture.

## Project  

### Titanic  
This is a small machine learning project, binary classification problem. By the project, you can learn the whole process of machine learning.
The process mainly includes six parts:
1. Data cleaning    
2. Feature engineering   
3. Basic model and evalution  
4. Hyperparameters tuning   
5. Predict results  

 I use SVM model to predict and get 0.80382 scores. You can jump to a specific page by clicking on this picture.
